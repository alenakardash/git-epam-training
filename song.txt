Hurts — Ready to Go

Jackie’s just 17,
and hard to please
She steps on the scene,
like a gypsy queen
And she’s looking at everybody,
with a secret smile
She got a black tattoo on her body
And it says

«When I die, yeah,
you know I’ll be ready to go»

You don’t know what she’s seen,
or where she’s been
But you catch her eye,
and it makes you freeze
And she’s looking at everybody,
with a secret smile
She got a black tattoo on her body
And it says
